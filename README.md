# New.css - A New CSS framework
As if we didn't already have enough bootstrap knock-off CSS frameworks - I've decided to create my own. This framework will use the bootstrap class naming convention due to the popular use and famility of it.
## Features
Current Features include
- Bootstrap-like Grid System, using flexbox.
- Responsive colour classes
- Changes to the `_settings.scss` will change generated css.
## Planned
Planned features:
- Navbar Grid System
- Implement Typography settings into `_settings.scss`
## Acknowledgements
- Grid inspired by the Bootstrap grid
- A mix of Foundation UI utilities
